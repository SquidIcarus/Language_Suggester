# Second Code Review

# https://github.com/SquidIcarus/Language_Suggester.git

## Programming Language Suggester


This project will display my knowledge of JavaScript and WebBrowsers through lessons taught at Epicodus.

## Main objectives for this project


- Form gathers input from the user.

- Branching is used to determine the result.

- Web API object properties or methods (not including window methods for alerting, prompting, or confirming) are used to display the result to the user.

- Event handler properties or event listeners are used to handle events.

- When the user submits the form again (for a second or third time) previous results are hidden, cleared, or replaced.

- Variable names are descriptive of what they represent and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).

- Web page is styled using custom CSS.

- Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

- The prompt's required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.
